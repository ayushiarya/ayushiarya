### Hi there !!
## This is Ayushi. I'm from Jamshepdur, India. Ever since I was a kid, I loved to understand the mechanics behind things. Be it dismantling a toycar to discover a top, reading encyclopedia sets cover to cover or trying to understand the mechanics behind a hummingbird flying. I always knew I was meant to engineer things.
## I am a 2020 Graduate from BITS Pilani-Hyderabad Campus, Electrical Engineering Department. I am interested in learning and understanding new problems and putting in my best efforts to solve them.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Improving my logical thinking and problem solving skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Things ranging from astronomy to react.js , whatever keeps me hooked. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email- ayushiarya8@gmail.com
