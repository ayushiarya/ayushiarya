# Hi there !

## This is Ayushi. I'm from Jamshepdur, India. 
## Ever since I was a kid, I loved to understand the mechanics behind things. Be it dismantling a toycar to discover a top, reading encyclopedia sets cover to cover or trying to understand the mechanics behind a hummingbird flying. I always knew I was meant to understand, breakdown and build things!
